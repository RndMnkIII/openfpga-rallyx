--  T80 instruction cycle timing.
--
--  Every other testbench in sim/ proves a clock RATE. This one proves the CPU
--  does the right amount of WORK per clock: that T80 spends the same number of
--  T-states on each instruction as a real Z80. Rally-X is interrupt-paced, so a
--  CPU that is clocked correctly but executes fast or slow still drifts against
--  the original -- and no raster or audio test would ever see it.
--
--  Method: run a program of known instructions and measure the gap between
--  consecutive M1_n assertions. M1_n falls at T1 of every opcode fetch, so the
--  clocks from one M1 to the next are exactly the T-states of the instruction
--  that was fetched first. Expected values are the published Z80 timings.
--
--  Only unprefixed opcodes are used: CB/ED/DD/FD prefixes assert M1 twice, so
--  an M1-to-M1 delta would report the prefix and the opcode separately rather
--  than the instruction as a whole.
--
--  T80s is instantiated with the same generics fpga_NRX ships (Mode=0 Z80,
--  T2Write=0, IOWait=1) so this measures what is actually in the bitstream.
--
--  Run:  ghdl -a --std=93 -fsynopsys <T80 sources> tb_t80_timing.vhd
--        ghdl -r --std=93 -fsynopsys tb_t80_timing
