--============================================================================
--  T80 interrupt acknowledge, mode 0.
--
--  Rally-X runs in interrupt mode 0 -- `ED 46` appears in the ROM, `ED 56` and
--  `ED 5E` do not. In mode 0 the CPU does not read a vector table: it latches
--  whatever byte is on the data bus during the acknowledge cycle and executes
--  it as an instruction. fpga_nrx.v drives that byte itself --
--
--      wire [7:0] irqv = ( (~m1) & (~ie) ) ? intv : 8'h00;
--
--  -- where intv is whatever the game last wrote with OUT. So the frame
--  interrupt only works if T80 asserts M1 and IORQ together, takes the byte
--  from the bus, and executes it. That handshake is glue we own and the timing
--  bench never touched it: tb_t80_timing ties INT_n high.
--
--  The memory model here mirrors fpga_nrx's data bus selector, vector included,
--  so what is under test is the arrangement the bitstream actually ships.
--
--  Method: hold INT_n low from reset and watch one interrupt all the way
--  through -- when it is accepted, where it vectors, what it stacked, how long
--  it took, and that it does not fire twice.
